bm2: ver0.sakura.ne.jp Basic Master Jr Emulator
===============================================

`bm2` is an emulator for the Hitachi Basic Master Jr. home computer. The
latest versions of it and related utilities are found on the [emulator's
home page][bm2] on ver0.sakura.ne.jp.

Older versions of the software are removed from that site when a new
version is posted; this archive contains those older versions. This can be
useful for serveral reasons:
1. Systems that automatically download the source code archive won't break
   when a new version is released.
2. The current version on the home page doesn't always work; e.g. the
   20241027 version doesn't compile as-is on Linux.

You can also find some (but not all) older versions on [this page on
archive.org][ar]. Enter "bm2" in the "filter results" box to see them more
easily.
